Here are a few options, playing on the unique brand concept:

**Option 1 (Direct & Playful):**
"Perfect! Time for a treat you never knew you needed, at a price you'll love."

**Option 2 (Emphasizing the Paradox):**
"Absolutely! And while you're at it, why not find that brand-new little something you *don't* need, for the least amount of money?"

**Option 3 (Focus on Indulgence & Affordability):**
"Sounds delightful! How about a brand-new little indulgence you don't need, at an unbeatable price?"

**Option 4 (Short & Punchy):**
"Perfect! Time to browse for that brand-new little something you don't *need*, but can totally afford."

Each of these options links the idea of a "break/teatime" with the brand's unique proposition of offering brand-new, unnecessary items at a very low cost, making them an accessible, guilt-free indulgence.
