Here are a few options, playing on both the teatime meaning and the brand concept:

**Option 1 (Direct & Playful):**
"Ah, teatime! The perfect moment to discover that brand-new, delightful little something you don't *really* need, but can't resist â€“ at a price that won't break your break!"

**Option 2 (Intriguing & Benefit-Oriented):**
"Excellent idea! Let's pause, recharge, and perhaps pick up that perfectly unnecessary, brand-new little joy you've been eyeing, all for the least amount of money."

**Option 3 (Concise & Evocative):**
"Teatime it is! And what better way to enjoy it than with a tiny, brand-new treat you absolutely don't *need*, but totally deserve, for a steal?"

**Option 4 (Focus on the Impulse):**
"Time for a cuppa... and perhaps a brand-new, surprisingly affordable impulse buy that just makes your day a little brighter, even if you don't 'need' it!"
