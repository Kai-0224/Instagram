Here are a few options, playing on different nuances of your brand concept:

**Option 1 (Emphasizing the 'Treat' & 'Value'):**
"Perfect! While the kettle boils, let's find you a brand-new little 'want' for a delightful steal."

**Option 2 (Focusing on Discovery & Guilt-Free Indulgence):**
"Excellent idea. Teatime is the perfect excuse to discover a brand-new treasure you don't *need*, for next to nothing!"

**Option 3 (More Playful & Direct):**
"Oh, good! Let's find you a charming, brand-new little impulse you absolutely don't *need*... for an irresistible price."

**Option 4 (Short & Sweet):**
"Absolutely! Time for a brand-new little luxury, for a little price."

Each of these options links the "break" (teatime) directly to the brand's core offering: brand-new products you don't need, at an incredibly low price.
