Here are a few options, playing on the brand concept:

**Option 1 (Direct & Playful):**
"Perfect! A break is the ideal time to find a brand-new little luxury you absolutely don't need, at a price you'll love."

**Option 2 (Emphasizing the 'Smart' aspect):**
"Excellent. While the tea brews, let's treat ourselves to a brand-new, 'just because' item for the least amount of money."

**Option 3 (More Conversational):**
"Indeed! Teatime is the perfect excuse to snag something shiny and new that you technically don't need, but can afford thanks to our deals."

**Option 4 (Short & Punchy):**
"Teatime! The best moment to grab a brand-new *something* you don't *need*, for next to nothing."
