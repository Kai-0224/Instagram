Ah, teatime, is it? Perfect! We've just received a fresh delivery of brand-new, utterly charming items you absolutely *don't* need, at prices so low they're practically giving them away.

How about a novelty tea infuser for that specific type of tea you never drink, or a set of decorative spoons that are just slightly too small for anything practical? All designed to bring you zero practical value, for the least amount of money possible!
