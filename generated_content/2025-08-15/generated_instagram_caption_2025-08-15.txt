Here are a few options for the brand's answer, playing on the provided context:

**Option 1 (Direct & Playful):**
"Excellent idea! And while you're at it, how about a brand-new little something you absolutely don't need, for practically nothing?"

**Option 2 (More Evocative & Suggestive):**
"Perfect! A moment to relax, refresh, and maybe even find that delightful, unexpected treat that costs next to nothing."

**Option 3 (Concise & Intriguing):**
"Wonderful! Teatime just got a little more exciting with a brand-new, 'unnecessary' delight for the lowest price."

**Option 4 (Focus on the *why* it's a good break):**
"Indeed! And what better way to make that break truly special than with a little, brand-new indulgence you didn't know you wanted, for next to nothing?"

All these options tie "teatime" to the brand's core concept of affordable, unneeded, new products.
